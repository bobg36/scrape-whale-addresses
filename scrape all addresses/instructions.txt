1. go to page 1 -> right click on table -> 'table-to-spreadsheet' (chrome plugin) -> 'csv'
	- have to do separately for 1-19 and 20-100 for some reason
	- save to txt file called 'page1.txt'

2. run 'scrape number1.py'

3. run '101-1000_scrape_address.ipynb' (.py isnt working for some reason)

4. join the 2 resulting files (address_list_date.txt and address_list.page1.txt)
